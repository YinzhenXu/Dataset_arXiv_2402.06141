This repository contains the main generated data associated with the paper "The electromagnetic form factors of heavy-light pseudo-scalar and vector mesons" (arXiv:2402.06141).

If you use this data in your work, please cite the paper via the following INSPIRE-HEP entry: https://inspirehep.net/literature/2757012

BibTeX and other citation formats are available at the link above.

Data format:

Each data file consists of two columns. The first column represents Q^2 in units of GeV^2, the second column gives the corresponding value of the form factor F(Q^2).

File descriptions:

udPS.dat: pi^+ meson

udVC1.dat, udVC2.dat, udVC3.dat: rho^+ meson

usPS.dat: K^+ meson 

â€¦

A sample Mathematica notebook (Plot.nb) is provided to demonstrate how to load and visualize the data.
