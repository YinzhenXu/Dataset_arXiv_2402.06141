Data descriptions:

This dataset provides the elastic electromagnetic form factors (EFFs) of mesons, including: 

pseudoscalar mesons: pi^+, K^+, K^0, D^+, D^0, D_s, B^+, B^0, B_s, B_c 

vector mesons: pi^+, K^\*+, K^\*0, D^\*+, D^\*0, D^\*_s, B^\*+, B^\*0, B^\*_s, B^\*_c 

Data format:

Each data file consists of two columns. The first column represents Q^2 in units of GeV^2, the second column gives the corresponding value of the EFFs F(Q^2).

File names:

udPS.dat: pi^+ meson

udVC1.dat, udVC2.dat, udVC3.dat: rho^+ meson

usPS.dat: K^+ meson 

â€¦

A sample Mathematica notebook (Plot.nb) is provided to demonstrate how to load and visualize the data.
